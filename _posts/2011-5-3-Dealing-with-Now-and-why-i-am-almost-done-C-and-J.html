<p>It's a common scenario to have to use the current time within code. A good example is timestamping an audit trail. As part of your code to create an <code>Audit</code> object, you might do something like:</p>

<pre data-language="generic">
var audit = new Audit
{
	UserName = user.Name,
	Dated = DateTime.Now,
	//...
};
</pre>

<p>The problem with the above code is that it's hard to test. Personally, I think testing that the proper time is used for your audit record is important. Depending on what field you're in, your lawyers might think so too. However, if we wrote a very specific test, we might be in for a surprise. Can you spot the problem?</p>

<pre data-language="generic">
public void ItSetsTheAuditTimeToRightNow()
{
	var audit = CreateAuditItem(new User{Name = "Leto"});
	audit.Dated.ShouldEqual(DateTime.Now);
}
</pre>

<p>Sometimes such a test will pass, sometimes it won't. Why? Because between setting DateTime.Now in the code and then verifying it in the test, the time might have changed.</p>

<p>What solution do we use? Well, when all you have is a hammer...That's right, I've seen this problem &quot;solved&quot; by injecting an abstract dependency into objects. Now we can mock and fully control the creation of time.</p>

<p>And you know what? That's just stupid. Getting the current time shouldn't need abstraction nor decoupling. I want to use DateTime.Now in my code and I want it to be testable. When a language or framework or whatever makes you jump through hoops to get the current time then something is broken.</p>

<p>In Ruby, you use Time.now. Why? Because Time in Ruby is an object. In C# or Java it'd be a class. But in Ruby, as well as most (all?) dynamic languages, it's an actual object. So we can just change it to do/be/return whatever we want whenever we want (like at runtime).</p>

<p>I don't think C++ developers who've spent 10+ years dealing with memory management have any concept of how much energy/productivity they spend on memory management. I don't think C#/Java developers have any concept of how much energy/productivity they spend on decoupling. Worse, I think many C#/Java developers don't understand that DI, interface-based programming, and fear of statics, is result of language limitations. Developers just think it's how you code - regardless of the language.</p>

<p>Not too long ago that was me...IoC, mocking, interfacing out the wazoo. I didn't realize that how I coded was really just a by-product of how my language required me to code. I think this was one of those fundamental eye openers for me. I've had a handful in my career and I always treasure them when they happen. </p>

<p>I do want to point out that C#'s lambdas largely solve this simple case. I don't need anyone to post a comment including <code>Func&lt;DateTime&gt;</code>. It isn't perfect, but it's certainly more than close enough for me. However, move to something just a little more complicated, and you're back at writing infrastructure and architecture rather than adding business value.</p>
