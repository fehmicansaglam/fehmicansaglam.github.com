<p>The project is called mogade, its free, and our <a href="http://www.github.com/mogade/">client libraries</a> are open sourced (we'd obviously love contributions). Its starting to be a crowded space, and there are more feature-rich solutions out there, but we're just getting started and we feel we can add real value. The team all worked together at a leading advergaming shop a few years back, so we know about casual game development and know where the pain points are.</p>

<p>Something of particular interest to my audience is probably our <a href="https://github.com/mogade/mogade-windowsphone">Windows Phone library</a>. Again, it doesn't have all the features we want, but if you are looking to get a game out and rather focus on your game that this extra stuff, I hope you'll take a look. Even if you are just looking for a project to learn WP7 programming you might be interested in contributing.</p>

<p>Of course, one of the nice things about working on projects like this is that you get to learn a lot, and if you blog, you get a bunch of new material to blog about. So hopefully in the coming weeks I'm going to be able to share some neat stuff that I've picked up. (for a sneak peak, I'm anxious to blog about the lightweight <a href="https://github.com/mogade/mogade-csharp/blob/master/Mogade.Tests.Core/FakeServer.cs">stub tcp server</a> I came up with for testing the C# library. its very reusable, you can check it out now if you want.)</p>

<p>So, do check out <a href="http://www.mogade.com/">mogade.com</a> and feedback, as always is welcomed.</p>
