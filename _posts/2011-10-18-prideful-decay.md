The light of our soul is extinguished. Humanity: an echo of potential. We march, to the empty beat of our lives, blind. Happiness we seek, where we know it does not hide. But we have grown fat, and lazy and stupid so we do not stray. Our lies show us the way.

There is nothing here to see. Nothing here to feel.
