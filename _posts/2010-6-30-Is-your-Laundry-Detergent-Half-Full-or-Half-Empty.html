title: "Is your Laundry Detergent Half Full or Half Empty?"

<p>There's a commercial running in Canada from Tide championing their 2x Ultra Tide - specifically that their detergent is only 40% water versus the 70% the competition uses. That, says Tide, means you get more cleaning ingredients for your money. I say getting screwed less is still getting screwed.</p>

<p>There's a point in the commercial where they show a 3/4 empty bottle (the competitor) and then fill it up just past the 1/2 way mark. Tide is pretty much telling you that you are paying twice what you should be. Its really stupid.</p>

<p>So I decided to do something about it - really the only thing consumers can do - and switched to a different product: <a href="http://www.methodhome.com/products-methodlaundry.aspx">Method's Laundry Detergent</a>. Method sells an 8x concentrate product made of biodegradable and renewable ingredients.</p>

<p>Method's product is more expensive - but thats almost always the case with environmentally friendly products (and Method's volume is undoubtedly a fraction of Tide's). Also, each of their bottles is individually shrink wrapped - which seems a little counter-productive to their environmental goals. I emailed Method about this (hey, I'm off work for a while, what else do I have going on?) - its a matter of practicality. They buy their label-less bottles (made from 50% recycled material) and then apply the label/shrinkwrap based on the scent they put in (based on demand). Eh, can't be perfect.</p>

<p>I've gone on more than I thought possible about Laundry Detergent, but there's one last neat thing about Method's product. Instead of an oversized cap, they use a pump mechanism. Supposedly, and unsurprisingly, the large cap with a nearly invisible fill-line is meant for us to over fill - thus using more product. Using too much laundry detergent doesn't just cost more, it can wear washing machines and clothes.</p>
