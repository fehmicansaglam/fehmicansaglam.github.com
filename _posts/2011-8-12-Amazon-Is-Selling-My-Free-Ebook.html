<p>I will keep this updated with new information at the top as I get it...</p>

<h3>Update 3 Saturday, August 13th</h3>
<p>It's done...yay! Thanks everyone</p>

<h3>Update 2 Saturday, August 13th</h3>
<p>I received an email from Amazon saying that they are in the process of taking it down and that it could take 2-3 days for it to be de-listed</p>

<h3>Update 1 Saturday, August 13th</h3>
<p>Yesterday I received an email from someone claiming to work for Amazon saying they saw the Hacker News thread and that the issue would be taken care of. He also said he'd "have more info shortly." Googling suggest this person is a director at Amazon.</p>

<p>However, when I woke up (12 hours later, which is practically the whole business day at Amazon), the book is still available, I've gotten no additional email.....and my comment has been removed</p>

<h3>Original Post Friday, August 12th</h3>
<p>On August 6th, I noticed that Foundations of Programming, an ebook which <a href="http://codebetter.com/karlseguin/2008/06/25/foundations-of-programming-ebook/">I released for free on June 25th 2008</a> was being <a href="http://www.amazon.com/FOUNDATION-PROGRAMMING-Building-Software-ebook/dp/B005BYS3FE">sold on Amazon</a> for the Kindle. Like any sane person, my first reaction was to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/karlseguin/status/99728780108644352">tweet about it</a>. If you actually look at the book on Amazon (you can click on it to see some of the contents), you'll note that at the very top, the book is licensed under a Creative Attribution-NonCommercial-Share-Alike 3.0 license.</p>

<p>Most of the feedback that I got was to 1 - leave a review (which I did, and you can see it) and 2 - contact amazon and tell them about it. Using <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/onlinesp/list/a_agents.html">this list</a>, I was able to find out that DMCA takedown notices should be sent to copyright@amazon.com.</p>

<p>My email said:</p>

<p>Before I sent my email, someone on twitter also sent an email to copyright@amazon.com, informing them of the problem (and CC'ing me)</p>

<p>So far, I have not heard back from Amazon and the book is still available for purchase. I also started <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2876637">a thread on Hacker News</a> which got popular very quickly.</p>
