<p>The most common MongoDB modeling question that gets asked has to do with when to use embedded documents versus multiple collections. First, for those unfamiliar with MongoDB, a quick recap.</p>

<p>As a document database, MongoDB can store embedded documents. As an example, we might have:</p>

<pre data-language="javascript">
{
  email: 'leto@dune.gov',
  password: 'spice',
  address: {
    street: 'The Citadel',
    city: 'Arrakeen',
    planet: 'Arrakis'
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Not only can you have embedded documents, but you can also have arrays of embedded documents, and you can have multiple levels of nesting.</p> MongoDB lets you index and query based on embedded keys, and it has special operator that let you push and pull values from an embedded array. All this to say that, in MongoDB, embedded documents and arrays are first-class citizens.</p>

<p>It's also worth pointing out that MongoDB doesn't support joins, this is important to keep in mind when you consider the two approaches. (You do a "join" on the client, by issuing 2+ queries). In the end, MongoDB gives you two choices to model relationships: use embedded documents, or go the traditional route and store things into two separate collections (essentially a table). So the question is, which should you pick?</p>

<p>There's no single answer to the question. It depends on a number of factors, not least of which is about the data you dealing with. Let's look at another example: a post with comments</p>

<pre data-language="javascript">
{
  title: 'MongoDB: Embedded Documents vs Multiple Collections',
  slug: 'embedded-documents-vs-multiple-collections',
  body: '...',
  comments: [
    {by: 'leto', body: '...', date: '...'},
    {by: 'ghanima', body: '...', date: '...'},
    {by: 'jessica', body: '...', date: '...'},
    {by: 'paul', body: '...', date: '...'}
  ]
}
</pre>

<p>The two examples represent different usage of embedded documents. The most obvious different is with respect to the number of elements. The first example is finite (in this case 1), the second example could grow forever. More importantly though, while an <code>address</code> can certainly be thought of as a standalone entity (especially if multiple users can have the same address), there's something just natural about saying that a user and an address are a single coherent entity. Conversely, I don't think it's a stretch to think of a both a post and a comment as having meaning/purpose by themselves.</p>

<p>Beyond this intuition, there are some technical matters to consider. In terms of performance, embedded documents won't require a client-side join, and can fetch the entire document in a single seek. This can have particularly meaningful impact when mixed with sharding. On the flip side, growing an array of embedded documents can force MongoDB to physically move where the document is stored (and have to update all indexes)</p>

<p>It is important to understand the performance implications, and more importantly the reasons why the performance characteristics are the way they are. However, if you don't already know which approach to take, performance probably shouldn't be what's driving your decision.</p>

<p>The other, much more relevant, consideration is, in my opinion, query flexibility. As much as embedded documents are first-class citizens, there's a limit to what you can do for queries. In the above example, we can't just get comments made by <code>leto</code>. We have to get the entire document. The next release of MongoDB should fix this (by allowing the positional operator <code>$</code> to be used in field selection).  Further down the road, virtual collections on embedded documents will also be added. However, for the time being, the only possible selection is indexed based (get comments 1-5, 5-10, ...), which is a serious drag.</p>

<p>Which should you use? They both have their use. Given that an embedded document is something you can't do in relational databases, they do get talked (and hyped) about a lot. However, I believe that <strong>you should favor separate collections</strong>. This is especially true if you are dealing with a potentially ever-growing array, or if you want to pull out specific embedded values. So the approach I would suggest is to first think of it stored in a separate collection and only then consider if it makes sense to embed. Distinct pieces of data, like our address, obviously makes sense to embed. Small and simple arrays, such as tags, also makes sense.</p>

<p>Worst case, pick one, try it out, and if it doesn't work out, change it.</p>
