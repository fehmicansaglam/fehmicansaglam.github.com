<p>Water pressure is high (could be building/location specific)</p>

<p>Some keypads (ATM, phones...) start with 1 in the upper left, some with 1 in the lower left. This really kills muscle memory.</p>

<p>Pedestrian crossing beep once per second when you aren't supposed to cross, and do a rolling beep when you can (in addition to the walk/don't walk signage). Newer escalators also do this - a slow beep meaning that you are going the wrong way.</p>

<p>Cars don't stop for pedestrians.</p>

<p>Pedestrians don't stop for pedestrians. Walking in Hong Kong is frustrating, you'll get cut off and people will seem like they are coming right for you. There's obviously a trick to it, because I've paid attention and no one else is running into each other. I'm doing something wrong...like looking up.</p>

<p>If you're buying something that says 3 for $10 - don't buy 4.</p>

<p>In Canada, with its suburbs, convenient stores charge a premium for being conveniently located. In Hong Kong, every store is convenient, so the many 7 elevens don't see to have that same premium.</p>

<p>If you plan on standing on an escalator, stay to the right. The left is the passing lane.</p>

<p>Air conditioners blast full strength and stores have no doors. Even huge buildings, like HSBC's headquarter, have air conditioned space opened to the elements.</p>

<p>Adidas's whole body antiperspirant spray ads don't seem so silly on day 2.</p>

<p>Buildings are so high, the region so mountainous and streets so curvy that trying to use the tall ICC and IFC2 buildings as points of reference is futile.</p>

<p>Although Hong Kong is made up of three parts - New Territories to the north, Hong Kong Island to the south, and Kowloon in the middle, <em>Hong Kong</em> refers to the island.</p>

<p>Although Kowloon is physically attached to China, it is not considered the <em>mainland</em>. So, when you land at the airport and you want to get to Kowloon, don't follow the <em>mainland</em> signs like I did.</p>

<p>Shopping malls don't have food courts. Restaurants are spread out all over the place.</p>

<p>Shopping malls, including the fanciest ones, have very few, if any, places to sit (except for restaurants).</p>

<p>Shopping malls have a lot of staff standing in the mall. They are definitely able and willing to provide information, but they might also serve a security purpose (not sure).</p>

<p>There is no residential recycling.</p>

<p>The MTR (subway) trains get really cold when moving.</p>

<p>Hong Kong island is very safe.</p>

<p>With low income tax, no sales, capital gains, or corporate taxes, the Hong Kong government makes its money by leasing land.</p>

<p>Metal and rubber studs/markers can be found throughout malls. This is to assist the blind.</p>
